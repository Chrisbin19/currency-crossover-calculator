# üí∞ Currency Crossover Calculator
### A modern, API-driven financial tool that reinvents the classic calculator by providing real-world context to numbers.
This project is a submission for the Vibe Coding Hackathon, designed to remix a classical app with new features and powerful API integrations.

**‚ú® Live Demo:** [**https://Chrisbin19.github.io/currency-crossover-calculator/**](https://Chrisbin19.github.io/currency-crossover-calculator/)

## üí° Project Motivation
A standard calculator tells you what a number is, but it never tells you what that number means. The goal of this project was to solve that problem by creating a tool that provides immediate financial context. By integrating three distinct APIs for live exchange rates, historical data, and real-time stock prices, this app transforms a simple calculation into a moment of genuine financial insight. It's designed for anyone who interacts with the global economy, from students and freelancers to aspiring investors.

## üöÄ Features
This project is packed with features that provide a rich user experience:

**Dual-Mode Functionality:** A sleek toggle allows users to seamlessly switch between a Classic Calculator for standard mathematical operations and an advanced Currency Mode for financial tasks.

**Live Currency Conversion:** Fetches real-time exchange rates from the ExchangeRate-API, providing accurate conversions between over 150 world currencies.

**Historical Data Visualization:** After every conversion, a beautiful 30-day historical line chart is rendered using Chart.js and data from the Frankfurter API. This allows users to instantly spot trends and understand currency volatility.

**Real-Time Investment Suggestions:** This is the core "remix" feature. After converting to INR, the app makes a live call to the Alpha Vantage API to fetch real-time prices of major Indian stocks, providing users with actionable investment ideas based on the converted amount.

**Sleek Glassmorphism UI:** The entire application is wrapped in a modern, beautiful, and fully responsive "glassmorphism" interface that looks professional on any device.
